## 🚀 Overview

EventSphere is a full-stack MVP event planning platform with dual dashboards for **Customers** and **Vendors**, powered by real-time AI recommendations via the Anthropic Claude API.

Built for a hackathon, this project demonstrates how AI can transform the traditional event planning experience — from vendor discovery to design recommendations to automated coordination.
